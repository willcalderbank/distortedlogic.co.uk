  While building this site it became clear that a database based CMS was overkill, thats when I discoverd <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> a very nice 'offline' CMS which with the use of templates will "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs". 
</p>
<p>
  A static site comes with a number of benifits manily performance and that you dont have to worry about a database, but also has its downsides. Editing posts becomes much harder, thankfully with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, Amazon S3, <a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website</a> and a little upload script this downside becomes less of problem. This script can be run automaticly when the site is pushed to github, which is very nice.
</p>
<p>
  First install <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website</a> next you create a new repo on github and clone it, now in that directory run:
</p>

<div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
<div class="panel text-center">
  {% highlight bash %}s3_website cfg create {% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>

<p>
This will create a s3_website.yaml file, fill it out with all your setting like <a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website suggests</a>. Remember to add this file to .gitignore or use enviroment variables!
